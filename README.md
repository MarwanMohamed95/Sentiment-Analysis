# **Sentiment Analysis**

In this Project we will be implementing sentiment analysis on tweets using two methods (Logistic Regression and naive Bayes). 
Given a tweet, we will decide if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. 

Specifically we will:

- Extract features given some text.
- Implement Classification model from scratch
- Apply the model on a natural language processing task.
- Testing the model.

After applying the two models on the sentiment analysis task we got about the same accuracy on the validation dataset with about 99.50%
